# OSMO Agent Strategy

**Thesis**: OSMO proves that complex development can be AI-native. The 5-layer framework (Context, Decision, Quality, Continuity, Meta-cognition) with DIF/LLM separation reduces human intervention from ~10+ per task to <=2. Dogfooded on OSMO's own development, generalizable to Physical AI pipelines and any domain. Fully open-source NVIDIA market-maker -- ecosystem gravity, not data moat.

## Current Status

**Where we are**: Framework designed, vertical slice implemented, E2E POC in design.

1. Strategy docs restructured to reflect evolved thesis (5-layer framework, DIF/LLM, market-maker model)
2. Vertical slice implemented: 8 DIF scripts, 5 knowledge docs, 4 service AGENTS.md files
3. Landscape analysis complete: evaluated 9 agent runtimes, 30+ MCP servers, 11 frameworks
4. **E2E POC designed**: Autonomous agent orchestrator that takes a natural language task, decomposes it, executes relentlessly across ephemeral sessions, communicates with humans async via object storage, and feeds intervention data back into the framework
5. **First POC task**: Pydantic v1→v2.12.5 migration (68 files, 212 BaseModel subclasses, 657 usages)
6. Next: implement the orchestrator, run the migration, measure interventions, improve framework

## Key Decisions (Top 7)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D11 | Dogfood first | Prove AI-native on OSMO development before external users |
| D12 | 5-layer framework | Context, Decision, Quality, Continuity, Meta-cognition -- covers full agent lifecycle |
| D13 | DIF/LLM separation | Default deterministic, escalate to LLM -- cheaper, more reliable, auditable |
| D14 | NVIDIA market-maker | Fully open-source code AND data -- K8s/Linux model |
| D24 | Agent-agnostic | AGENTS.md convention, not Claude-specific -- works with any agent runtime |
| D25 | Autonomous orchestrator | Agent runs without babysitting -- object storage as state, async human interaction |
| D28 | Intervention feedback loop | Every human interaction logged, categorized, and fed back as framework improvement |

See [decisions/decided.md](decisions/decided.md) for all 31 decisions.

## How Thinking Evolved

```
Original plan (Mar 2026)
  "Build a 4,750-LOC agent harness with 25+ knowledge files,
   OpenShell/OpenClaw/NemoClaw integration, three personas"
        |
        v
Critical review
  "The plan couples to three alpha dependencies released the same week.
   It's a vision document masquerading as an architecture document."
        |
        v
Market + competitive analysis
  "Physical AI workflow orchestration has zero competitors.
   Most of the harness plan duplicates what existing tools already do."
        |
        v
The pivot: OSMO as agentic substrate
  "Don't build an agent. Build the substrate that makes any agent
   effective at Physical AI. Primitives + tools + domain knowledge
   = emergent capabilities."
        |
        v
Stress-testing + refinement
  "The substrate idea is right, but the moat isn't data flywheel --
   it's ecosystem position. The GTM isn't self-healing -- it's scale
   transition. And the biggest proof is dogfooding on OSMO itself."
        |
        v
The 5-layer AI-native framework
  "LLMs are capable enough. The bottleneck is the harness.
   5 layers x DIF/LLM separation. Dogfood on OSMO, then generalize."
        |
        v
E2E POC: Autonomous agent orchestrator
  "Don't babysit agents. Build an orchestrator that runs relentlessly
   across ephemeral sessions, persists state to object storage,
   surfaces questions async, and improves itself from every
   human intervention. First task: Pydantic v1->v2 migration."
```
