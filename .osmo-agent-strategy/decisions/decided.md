# Decisions Made

These decisions emerged through research, analysis, and stress-testing. Each is supported by evidence from the research files.

## Strategic Decisions

### D1: OSMO is a substrate, not a product

**Decision**: Position OSMO as an agentic substrate that enables emergent AI-driven capabilities, not as a fixed product with prescribed workflows.

**Reasoning**: The six market opportunities are not separate products to build sequentially. They are what emerges when capable agents get access to OSMO's primitives. Building the substrate (MCP server + domain knowledge + telemetry) enables all six simultaneously.

**Evidence**: Zero competitors in Physical AI workflow orchestration. Every adjacent category has strong incumbents. The unique opportunity is at the intersection.

### D2: Build pipeline intelligence, integrate everything else

**Decision**: Only build agent capabilities for Physical AI pipeline orchestration (Persona C). Integrate with existing tools for development (5-layer framework on Claude Code) and operations (kagent/Komodor/PagerDuty).

**Evidence**: Claude Code + AGENTS.md solves dev assistance. Komodor (95% accuracy), kagent (CNCF), PagerDuty solve operations. Only pipeline intelligence requires OSMO's unique primitives.

### D3: MCP server, not custom agent runtime

**Decision**: Expose OSMO as an MCP server so any agent runtime can consume it. Do not build a custom agent runtime.

**Evidence**: MCP is a Linux Foundation protocol with 10,000+ servers, 97M+ monthly SDK downloads. Plugin APIs change monthly (OpenClaw had 3 major refactors in 3 months). MCP survives agent runtime churn.

### D4: 8-10 tools maximum, outcome-oriented

**Decision**: The MCP server has 8-10 tools designed around agent goals, not API endpoints.

**Evidence**: Vercel: 15 tools -> 80% accuracy; 2 tools -> 100% accuracy with 3.5x speedup. Phil Schmid's MCP best practices: 5-15 tools per server.

## Tactical Decisions

### D5: Zero alpha dependencies in MVP

**Decision**: The MVP has no dependency on OpenShell, NemoClaw, or OpenClaw. Pure Python MCP server with stdio transport.

**Evidence**: All three released as alpha on March 16, 2026. Breaking API changes within weeks of release.

### D6: Start with 3-5 files, not 25

**Decision**: The file tree starts with AGENTS.md + progress files + verification scripts. No 25-file knowledge tree.

**Evidence**: OpenAI: giant AGENTS.md fails. Models degrade past ~100K tokens. 3 accurate files beat 25 stale files.

### D7: Cost controls are mandatory, not optional

**Decision**: The MCP server includes tool invocation limits, cost estimation before workflow submission, and a dead-man switch.

**Evidence**: The original plan's "No cost ceiling guarantee" is unacceptable for GPU workflows at $25-40K/GPU-day.

### D8: Validation before expansion

**Decision**: Run 5 real tasks with the framework. Measure human interventions, wall-clock time, failure modes. Only expand after evidence.

**Evidence**: Stripe: 3M tests before 1,300 autonomous PRs/week. Anthropic: incremental feature-by-feature progress.

### D9: Phase 1 starts with Self-Healing Training Infrastructure

**Decision**: The first market opportunity (after dogfood) is self-healing training infrastructure.

**Evidence**: Closest to existing operator code. Immediately measurable ROI (GPU-hours saved). Doesn't require accumulated telemetry.

### D10: Generate knowledge from code, don't manually author it

**Decision**: Where possible, derive knowledge files from code rather than manually writing them.

**Evidence**: 121 API routes that change with normal PRs. Manual knowledge goes stale. CI-based generation catches drift automatically.

---

## Framework Decisions (New)

### D11: Dogfood first

**Decision**: Prove the AI-native framework on OSMO's own development before targeting external users.

**Reasoning**: If the framework can't improve AI-assisted development of OSMO itself -- a complex multi-language, multi-service platform -- it won't work for Physical AI pipelines. OSMO development is the hardest test case we control.

### D12: 5-layer framework

**Decision**: Context, Decision, Quality, Continuity, Meta-cognition are the five layers needed for effective AI-assisted work.

**Reasoning**: Derived from analyzing what goes wrong with AI agents: they can't find information (Context), make architectural mistakes (Decision), declare done without verification (Quality), lose progress between sessions (Continuity), and get stuck without realizing it (Meta-cognition). Each layer addresses a specific failure mode.

### D13: DIF/LLM separation

**Decision**: Default to Deterministic Infrastructure Functions (DIF). Escalate to LLM only when deterministic approaches fail.

**Reasoning**: Most harness work doesn't need an LLM. File routing is grep. Constraint checking is scripting. Verification is running tests. DIF is cheaper ($0 vs. tokens), more reliable (deterministic), auditable (readable scripts), and faster (milliseconds vs. seconds).

### D14: NVIDIA market-maker model

**Decision**: Fully open-source code AND data. K8s/Linux model: ecosystem gravity, not data moat.

**Reasoning**: OSMO's success metric is GPU-hours orchestrated, not software revenue. Data moats create lock-in which slows adoption. Ecosystem gravity creates pull which accelerates adoption. Faster adoption = more GPU demand = NVIDIA revenue.

### D15: GTM wedge is scale transition, not self-healing

**Decision**: The go-to-market entry point is helping existing OSMO users through scale transitions (1->3 clusters, 8->64 GPUs, 1->5 teams), not selling self-healing to new users.

**Reasoning**: Self-healing requires explaining latent pain. Scale transition is acute pain that existing users experience at predictable inflection points.

### D16: Positioning: "How Physical AI goes from research to production fleets"

**Decision**: This is the one-sentence positioning statement for OSMO's agent capabilities.

**Reasoning**: Specific enough to be meaningful, broad enough to be true. Captures the full pipeline lifecycle without being vague.

### D17: Multi-cluster heterogeneous is THE differentiator within NVIDIA stack

**Decision**: Within the NVIDIA ecosystem, OSMO's unique contribution is orchestrating workflows ACROSS clusters with different GPU types and configurations.

**Reasoning**: Isaac Sim, Omniverse, NIM, Data Factory each operate on one cluster. OSMO is the connective tissue that enables cross-cluster pipelines.

### D18: Capability unlock (Version B), not friction reduction (Version A)

**Decision**: OSMO enables workloads that CAN'T EXIST without multi-cluster orchestration, not just faster versions of existing workloads.

**Reasoning**: "Run SDG on CPU cluster, training on H100 cluster, eval on edge devices -- as one pipeline" is a capability only OSMO provides. "Submit jobs in 2 clicks instead of 20" can be replicated by any tool.

### D19: Ecosystem gravity, not data moat

**Decision**: Replace all "data moat" language with "ecosystem gravity." The flywheel data is fully open.

**Reasoning**: K8s/Linux model. Fully open, community-contributed. NVIDIA benefits from deepest integration. No lock-in, maximum adoption velocity.

### D20: Promise 2 of 6 opportunities in 2026, build substrate for all 6

**Decision**: Only self-healing and compliance are feasible in 2026. The others require accumulated telemetry (12-18 months) or market maturity.

**Reasoning**: Honest sequencing prevents over-promising. Phase 1 builds the substrate that enables all 6 over time.

### D21: Hybrid MCP + event hooks architecture

**Decision**: MCP for agent-initiated queries (pull), event hooks for push notifications (cluster health changed, run failed).

**Reasoning**: MCP alone is insufficient. Events the agent needs to know about but didn't ask for require a push mechanism.

### D22: Phase 1 tools valuable without flywheel

**Decision**: Phase 1 tools use hard-coded domain knowledge, not data-driven recommendations. The flywheel data (pipeline intelligence) takes 12-18 months to accumulate.

**Reasoning**: Cold-start reality. Tools must be useful on day 1. Historical telemetry makes them better over time but isn't required for initial value.

### D23: Vertical slice implementation

**Decision**: Implement thin through all 5 layers, not deep in one. Basic context + basic decisions + basic quality + basic continuity + basic meta-cognition > perfect context alone.

**Reasoning**: Only a full-stack slice proves the framework works end-to-end. Layers interact (quality gates need context routing, meta-cognition needs quality results). Real usage data guides deepening priorities.

### D24: Agent-agnostic: AGENTS.md convention, not Claude-specific

**Decision**: All framework files use the AGENTS.md convention (works with any agent runtime), not CLAUDE.md or any vendor-specific format.

**Reasoning**: Claude Code, Codex, kagent, and future agents all read AGENTS.md. Vendor lock-in on the framework defeats the market-maker model.

## E2E POC Decisions

### D25: Autonomous orchestrator -- no babysitting

**Decision**: The agent orchestrator runs autonomously in ephemeral cloud compute. No human watches it. It persists all state to object storage and communicates with humans async.

**Reasoning**: The user journey is: give a prompt, walk away, check back when notified. If the agent needs human input, it surfaces structured questions and continues working on unblocked subtasks. Babysitting defeats the purpose of AI-native development.

### D26: Object storage as canonical state, transport as plugin

**Decision**: Object storage (S3) is the single source of truth for all orchestrator state. The human interaction channel (web UI, Slack, GitHub, CLI) is a pluggable transport that reads/writes to storage.

**Reasoning**: Decouples state persistence from human interaction. The orchestrator writes state once; any number of UIs can read it. Changing from web UI to Slack requires only a new reader/writer, not orchestrator changes.

### D27: Strict envelope, fluid content schema

**Decision**: Object storage files use strict fields for state machine logic (`id`, `status`, `timestamps`, `phase`) and fluid fields for LLM-generated content (`context`, `reasoning`, `question`, `options`).

**Reasoning**: DIF/LLM separation applied to data. The orchestrator and web UI need reliable structure to make routing decisions (DIF). The agent needs freedom to express nuance in questions and context (LLM). New capabilities don't require schema migrations -- just richer content in fluid fields.

### D28: Intervention feedback loop

**Decision**: Every human interaction is logged with category, avoidability assessment, and a proposed framework fix. After task completion, the orchestrator generates patches to knowledge docs and DIF scripts.

**Reasoning**: This is how the framework learns. Without the feedback loop, every task is independent. With it, each task makes future tasks cheaper. The intervention log is also the primary evidence for the ≤2 interventions thesis.

### D29: Relentless execution -- keep going until done or fully blocked

**Decision**: The orchestrator works on any unblocked subtask. If one subtask is blocked on a human question, it moves to the next. It only pauses when every remaining subtask is blocked.

**Reasoning**: Maximizes throughput. A 38-subtask migration where 1 subtask is blocked shouldn't idle 37 others. The cron/supervisor ensures new sessions keep spawning. Answer webhooks trigger immediate resumption.

### D30: Pydantic v1→v2 as first POC task

**Decision**: The first task through the autonomous orchestrator is migrating OSMO from Pydantic v1 (1.10.26) to v2 (2.12.5). 68 files, 212 BaseModel subclasses, 657 usages.

**Reasoning**: Perfect proof-of-concept: cross-cutting (touches every Python service), has clear success criteria (all tests pass, no v1 patterns remain), exercises all 5 layers (context routing for discovery, decision enforcement for architectural boundaries, quality gates for regression detection, continuity across many sessions, meta-cognition for self-correction). Complex enough to be convincing, scoped enough to be completable.

### D31: Static web UI for POC human interaction

**Decision**: The POC human interface is a single static HTML file hosted on S3. No framework, no build step, no backend server. Reads state from S3, renders questions, writes answers via presigned URLs.

**Reasoning**: Fastest path to demonstrating async human-agent interaction. The web UI is not the product -- the orchestrator is. Spending time on a rich UI before the orchestrator works is premature optimization.
