**User Guide**
================================

**OSMO** is an open-source workflow orchestration platform purpose-built for Physical AI and robotics development.

Write your entire development pipeline for physical AI (training, simulation, hardware-in-loop testing) in declarative **YAML**. OSMO automatically coordinates tasks across heterogeneous compute, managing dependencies and resource allocation for you.

.. admonition:: 🚀 From workstation to cloud in minutes
  :class: info

  Develop on your laptop. Deploy to EKS, AKS, GKE, on-premise, or air-gapped clusters. **Zero code changes.**

`Physical AI <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/>`_ development uniquely requires orchestrating three types of compute:

* 🧠 **Training GPUs** (GB200, H100) for deep learning and reinforcement learning

* 🌐 **Simulation Hardware** (RTX PRO 6000) for realistic physics and sensor rendering

* 🤖 **Edge Devices** (Jetson AGX Thor) for hardware-in-the-loop testing and validation

**OSMO** solves this `Three Computer Problem <https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/three-computers-robotics/>`_ for robotics by orchestrating your entire robotics pipeline with simple YAML workflows—no custom scripts, no infrastructure expertise required. By solving this fundamental challenge, OSMO brings us one step closer to making Physical AI a reality.


Why Choose OSMO
----------------

.. grid:: 2
    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: 🚀 Zero-Code Orchestration
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Write workflows in **simple YAML** - no coding overhead. Define what you want to run, OSMO handles the rest.

    .. grid-item-card:: ⚡ Group Scheduling
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Run training, simulation, and edge testing **simultaneously** across heterogeneous hardware in a single workflow.

    .. grid-item-card:: 🌐 Truly Portable
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Same workflow runs on your **laptop, cloud, or on-premise**—no infrastructure rewrites as you scale.

    .. grid-item-card:: 💾 Smart Storage
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Content-addressable datasets with **automatic deduplication** save 10-100x on storage costs.

    .. grid-item-card:: 🔧 Interactive Development
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Launch **VSCode, Jupyter, or SSH** into running tasks for live debugging and development.

    .. grid-item-card:: 🎯 Infrastructure-Agnostic
        :class-card: sd-border-1

        Write workflows without knowing (or caring) about underlying infrastructure. **Focus on robotics, not DevOps.**


How It Works
----------------

**Example Workflow:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Your entire physical AI pipeline in a YAML file
   workflow:
     tasks:
     - name: simulation
       image: nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim
       platform: rtx-pro-6000          # Runs on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 GPUs

     - name: train-policy
       image: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch
       platform: gb200                 # Runs on NVIDIA GB200 GPUs
       resources:
         gpu: 8
       inputs:                         # Feed the output of simulation task into training
        - task: simulation

     - name: evaluate-thor
       image: my-robot:latest
       platform: jetson-agx-thor       # Runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor
       inputs:
        - task: train-policy           # Feed the output of the training task into eval
       outputs:
        - dataset:
            name: thor-benchmark       # Save the output benchmark into a dataset
