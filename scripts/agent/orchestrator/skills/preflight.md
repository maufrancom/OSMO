# Skill: Preflight

**Align your container's runtime with the repo's target versions.** "Close enough" is not aligned — you must match exactly.

## What to do

1. Discover what runtimes and versions the repo targets by reading its build configs.
2. Check what your container has.
3. If there is a mismatch, install the correct version. You have `sudo` access. If installation fails, you are **blocked** — report it and exit. Do not proceed with a mismatched environment.
4. Verify alignment by running the repo's build command.
5. Write `/tmp/environment.json`. This is a runtime artifact — do NOT commit it.
