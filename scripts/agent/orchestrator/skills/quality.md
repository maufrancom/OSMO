# Skill: Quality

Validation is a HARD GATE. You cannot declare success without it. If you made code changes but can't validate them, you are **blocked**, not done.

## Discover Before Validating

During the Discovery phase, you should have identified how this repo validates code. Use whatever you found:

- Repo-specific scripts (e.g., `scripts/agent/quality-gate.sh`, `make test`, `npm run lint`)
- CI config commands (from `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`)
- Package scripts (from `package.json` scripts section)
- Makefile targets

**Prefer repo-specific tooling** over generic checks. If the repo has a quality gate script, it was built for this codebase and knows things you don't.

## Fallbacks (When Repo Has No Tooling)

| Build System / Language | Quick check | Full check |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Bazel | `bazel build //src/...` | `bazel test //src/...` |
| Python | `python -m py_compile <file>` | `python -m pytest` (if tests exist) |
| Go | `go vet ./...` | `go test ./...` |
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | `npm test` (if configured) |
| Rust | `cargo check` | `cargo test` |
| Generic | syntax check the changed files | run whatever tests exist |

## When to Validate

- After modifying code, before committing: at minimum run the quick check
- After pulling a child's changes: verify the combined state is healthy
- Before declaring the entire task done: run the full check

Use your judgment on frequency. But before declaring done: run the full check. No exceptions.

## When You Can't Run Validation

If a tool is blocked, unavailable, or broken:
1. **Do NOT declare success.** You are blocked, not done.
2. Report exactly what validation you couldn't run and why.
3. List what commands need to be run manually.
4. Exit with a non-zero status so the orchestrator knows you're not finished.

An agent that changes 70 files and says "done" without running tests is worse than an agent that changes 70 files and says "blocked — couldn't run tests." The first creates false confidence. The second is honest.

## When Validation Fails

1. Read the error output carefully
2. Fix the issue yourself if you can
3. If you can't fix it after a reasonable attempt:
   - Revert: `git revert --no-edit HEAD && git push`
   - Ask a human (see `human-interaction.md`)
   - Try a different approach

Don't keep retrying the same approach. If it failed twice with similar errors, the approach is wrong.
