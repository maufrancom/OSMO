/**
 * Workflow Detail Page
 *
 * Displays a single workflow with:
 * - DAG visualization of workflow groups and their dependencies
 * - Unified multi-layer inspector panel (workflow → group → task)
 * - URL-synced navigation for shareable deep links
 *
 * Architecture (Side-by-Side Model):
 * - Uses flexbox layout with DAG and Panel as siblings
 * - DAG canvas fills available space (flex-1)
 * - Panel has fixed percentage width
 * - Components are completely decoupled
 *
 * URL Navigation:
 * - /workflows/[name] → Workflow view
 * - /workflows/[name]?group=step-1 → Group view
 * - /workflows/[name]?group=step-1&task=my-task&retry=0 → Task view
 *
 * Keyboard Navigation:
 * - Escape → Collapse panel (when expanded)
 * - Enter → Expand panel (when focused on collapsed strip)
 * - Browser back/forward → Navigate through URL history
 *
 * Performance:
 * - ReactFlow is bundled with this route (not lazy-loaded)
 * - Dagre layout runs synchronously for instant DAG rendering
 * - Server prefetches workflow data before client loads
 * - DAG renders immediately when page loads (no spinner delay)

// =============================================================================
// Direct Import for ReactFlow
// =============================================================================
// RATIONALE: Workflow pages are the PRIMARY use case for this app.
// The previous dynamic() import with ssr: false caused unnecessary delays:
//   1. User navigates to workflow page
//   2. Server prefetches data (fast! ✓)
//   3. Client receives hydrated data (instant! ✓)
//   4. Browser downloads ReactFlow chunk... (SLOW! ✗)
//   5. Finally renders DAG
//
// By importing directly:
//   - Next.js automatic route-based code splitting still applies
//   - ReactFlow is bundled with THIS route, not the global bundle
//   - No download delay - chunk is already part of the route bundle
//   - DAG renders immediately when data is ready
//
// Trade-off: Slightly larger route bundle (~200KB), but:
//   - This IS the main feature - users expect it immediately
//   - Route-level splitting means other pages aren't affected
//   - Much better UX for the 99% use case

/**
 * Workflow Detail Content (Client Component)
 *

 *
 * This is separated from the page.tsx to allow server-side prefetching
 * while keeping all interactive functionality client-side.
 *
 * Performance: ReactFlow is imported directly (not dynamically) because
 * workflow visualization is the primary feature. Next.js route-based code
 * splitting ensures other pages aren't affected.
